## Classification, Segmentation and Visual Query Answeing (VQA) with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

These are 3 independent projects developed on Python using Tensorflow on Convolutional Neural Networks. 
The first dealt with Multiclass image classification (mainly using Transfer Learning), the second was focused on Image Segmentation, using a patch based mechanism with U-Net. Finally the third project was focused on VQA combing an image feature extractor with an attention Mechanism.

For each project the code versions for Windows/Linux and for OSX are included.
