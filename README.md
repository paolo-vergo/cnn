# Classification, Segmentation and Visual Query Answeing with Convolutional Neural Network 

These are 3 independent projects on CNN developed with **Python using Tensorflow** 

# Structure 

1. Multiclass image classification (mainly using Transfer Learning)
2. Image Segmentation, using a patch based mechanism with U-Net
3. VQA combing an image feature extractor with an attention Mechanism

For each project the code versions for Windows/Linux and for OSX are included.
